Computational Project 1 deals with a three-component decay chain. The CodeOutput program reads the input file, labeled Sample Input File.txt, and creates an output file with all of the relevant data, in the json format. The CodeGraph program then reads the output json file and graphs it. The input file will have the data all listed out, and to change the parameters, just open the file and change the relevant numbers. The sample parameters include the word stable for the decay of element C, which represents the fact that C does not decay. The words after the numbers are for human understanding of units, not for the program, so changing them will not do anything. There will be two programs one for generating the output file and one for generating the plots. Initially, you can run the two programs with the example data to generate the output file and associated graphs.
