Computation Project 1 deals with a three component decay chain. It reads the input file, labeled inputFileProject1 and creates an output file with all of the relevant data. The program then reads the output file and then graphs it. The input file will have the data all listed out, and to change the parameters, just open the file and change the relevant data. There will be two programs one for generating the output file and one for generating the plots. Initially, you can run the two programs with the example data to generate the file and output file.
